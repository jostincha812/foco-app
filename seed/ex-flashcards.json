The solera system is made up of a number of groups of butts, reffered to here as levels, which holds wines of different ages. These levels are called criadera and solera. The maturation process invovles moving wines between the levels. Theis is archived as below:\n- Wine of bottling or blending is taken out of the system from the level that holds wines of the oldest average called the solera.\n- The solera is not fully emptied and the butts are replenished with wine from another level that contains wine of a slightly younger average of age called the first criadera,\n- The first criadera is then replenished by wine from the second criadera and so on, each criadera being replenished with younger wine.\n- The criadera containing the youngest wine is usually replenished with sobretable wine.\nThe numbers of criadera can vary from as few as three to as many as fourteen.\nBy law producer may only take a third of the wine from a solera system in the course of a year.",
